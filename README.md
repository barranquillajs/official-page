Welcome to the BarranquillaJS official page repository

## Getting Started

1. Install dependecies

```bash

  yarn install

 ```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:4321/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
